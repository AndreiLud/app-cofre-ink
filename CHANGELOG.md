# Changelog

Every release, what changed in it, and what to do about it if you are running this.

Versions follow semantic versioning. While the first number is zero, the second one
changes when something breaks and the third when nothing does.

## 0.1.0

Released on 23 September 2026. The first published version.

### What it does

**Records.** Accounts, cards with a real invoice cycle, instalments, transfers, planned
and settled. A whole record written on one line: `mercado 42,90 ontem nubank 3x`.

**Sorting.** Categories two levels deep, spending priority, and rules that sort by
themselves and learn from a correction.

**Repeating.** Series that write their own records, and a calendar of what falls due.

**Planning.** Limits per category or per priority, a save first rule, goals with a date,
and a projection of the next months built from what is already written, what repeats,
and what an ordinary month looks like.

**Sharing.** A space has members with roles. An expense splits evenly, by share or by
income, and a settle up says who owes whom, once.

**Reading a statement.** CSV, OFX, QIF, XLSX and JSON, plus a PDF reader written by hand
for card invoices and receipts. Nothing is written before you have seen it.

**Saying something back.** Findings over your own records, each one carrying the figures
it was made from. Nothing about what to buy or where to put money.

**Leaving.** Export as JSON or as a spreadsheet, restore anywhere, keep a copy in a file,
a WebDAV folder, an online database or a Google spreadsheet. Two devices agree by
exchanging a change log, over a server or through a file somebody carries.

**Offline.** The whole interface is kept by a service worker, so it opens on a train.

### The three ways to run it

1. In the browser alone, with the database inside that browser and nothing over the
   network.
2. With a server of your own, as one container carrying the API and the interface.
3. With a cloud you pay for, keeping a copy where you choose.

### What is worth knowing before you rely on it

1. **The statement readers have never seen a real bank statement.** They are built from
   the formats and tested against files written for the tests. Expect to correct a
   column mapping the first time, and expect the correction to be remembered.
2. **A copy in a WebDAV folder has only been tested against a stand in**, never against
   a real Nextcloud.
3. **Turnstile has never been tested against the real Cloudflare service**, only against
   a double. The proof of work in front of the sign in has, and it is the one that is on
   by default.
4. **In browser mode there is no password.** The address can be public without exposing
   anything of yours, and whoever opens your browser sees your data. Both of those are
   true at the same time and the front door says so.

### Installing

The interface is a folder of static files that any host will serve. The server is one
container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4321:4321 -v cofre:/data -e COFRE_SECRET=... ghcr.io/andreilud/app-cofre-ink:0.1.0
```
